# CleanTF2plus

A sequel to the original Clean TF2 mod. Designed to provide mods that reduces visual clutter and increase fps.

## Features

CleanTF2+ makes use of batch files to generate mods for you. Being automatically generated means that it:
- stays updated easier
- allows for options to enable or disable
- is a smaller download
- functions offline
- can be tailored to individual needs

## Install

1. Download zip
2. Unzip to custom folder
3. Run generate.bat
4. Select the options you want

&#8203;* Some options can take a while to fully run, because they need to work with huge amounts of files. Taking several minutes can be expected.

## Turn into VPK

VPK mods result in faster load times than mods in folders. For this reason, a utility is provided to convert CleanTF2+ into vpk files.

When you have fully generated the options you wanted:
1. Run pack_vpk.bat
2. Move/delete CleanTF2plus folder out of custom (otherwise there is no load time benefit)
