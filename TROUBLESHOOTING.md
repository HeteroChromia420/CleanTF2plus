You may run into issues installing and running properly. This serves as an FAQ for some common issues when installing.

## Empty folders

> When I run it, I get no errors, but the materials / models / etc. folders are empty

The most common cause of this is CleanTF2plus not being in the proper install directory. It should exist in:

```
steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\CleanTF2plus
```
